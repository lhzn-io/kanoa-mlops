# kanoa-mlops Documentation

This directory contains planning documents and analysis for the `kanoa-mlops` infrastructure.

## Structure

Living documents with checklists and roadmaps.

- **[Infrastructure_Spec.md](planning/Infrastructure_Spec.md)**: Core infrastructure specification and roadmap

### `analysis/` (Future)

Static, dated snapshots of architectural decisions and investigations.

## Documentation Philosophy

- **Planning docs**: Use `[✓]` for completed items, `[ ]` for planned items
- **Analysis docs**: Dated snapshots (e.g., `20251130-vllm-performance-analysis.md`)
- **Keep it concise**: Infrastructure docs should be scannable and actionable
