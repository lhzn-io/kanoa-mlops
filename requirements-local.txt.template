# Local development requirements (GITIGNORED)
# This file overrides requirements.txt for local co-development of kanoa + kanoa-mlops
#
# Setup:
#   cp requirements-local.txt.template requirements-local.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-local.txt
#
# This installs kanoa as an editable package from your local sibling directory,
# so changes to ../kanoa are immediately reflected without reinstalling.

# Editable local kanoa with all backends + notebook display
-e ../kanoa[all]

# Alternative: select specific backends to reduce dependencies
# -e ../kanoa[gemini,notebook]      # Gemini only
# -e ../kanoa[claude,notebook]      # Claude only
# -e ../kanoa[gemini,claude]        # Multiple backends, no notebook extras

# Include dev dependencies (linting, testing, etc.)
-r requirements-dev.txt
